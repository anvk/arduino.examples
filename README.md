Arduino code snippets:

LedBrightnessChange - code which will allow the board to adjust brightness of LED depending on how bright is the environment using light sensor. The change in brightness happens slowly over time instead of an instanteneous change.
The example how you can wire up your component can be found here: http://arduino.cc/playground/Learning/LEDSensor
